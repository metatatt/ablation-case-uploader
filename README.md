## Procedural Flow

The app supports the following flow:

1. **Integration with CPT Codes**: Leverage the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) provided by AAPC to standardize and reference procedures.
2. **Upload Mapping Videos**: Users can upload their mapping videos which may include both the map wavefront log video and the associated log text.
3. **Identify EP Activities**: Highlight and document EP activities that take place in the lesion loci.
4. **Mapping Signal Types**: The platform supports various mapping signal types such as voltage, activation, and charge density.
5. **Optional Transseptal Access**: Depending on the procedure and user preference, transseptal access can be included.
6. **Post Ablation Mapping Video**: Capture and upload post-ablation videos to document results.
7. **Case Summary**: At the end of the flow, users can generate a summary of the entire case for review or presentation.
